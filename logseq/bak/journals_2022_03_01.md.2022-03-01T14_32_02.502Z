- Invoiced ISTA for February
	- Invoice was done through Harvest instead of Freshbooks
- Listened to French radio this morning and was able to understand a bit of the weather report but realized it _after_ they did the weather for Quebec
- Planning trip to Montreal to see Caroline at the same time she's there, will piggy back with [[Northeast US Trip]]
- Planning to try a new restaurant for [[Mardi's Visit to Quebec]]

- # Proficiencies - Staff Engineer
	- ### Craft
		- 游릭 Proven in-depth mastery of some of the technologies used by Wealthsimple
		- 游릯 Builds large systems and maintains them over an extended period of time
		- 游댮 Makes strong technical decisions about new technologies by staying on top of technical trends outside of WS, deeply and efficiently researching opportunities, creating prototypes and driving adoption across multiple teams
		- 游댮 Creates and maintains high quality documentation of the systems they work on. Makes complex processes approachable to more junior engineers through diagrams and writing
	- ### Practice
		- 游리 Leverages internal/external people resources and written sources to research and build expertise
			- Very good at researching, have been pretty self-sufficient when it comes to on-call and only reach out to people when I've exhausted all other options.
		- 游댮 Work has significant impact on many teams or orgs through building shared-libraries and dev tools, solving unusual and difficult technical challenges, and successfully completing high stakes projects as a lead or IC
		- 游댮 Contributes significantly to hiring and hiring best practices for senior roles
		- 游리 Actively participates in meetings and drives cross-team collaboration when necessary
			- Specifically in the most recent [[Accept/Reject Bulk Importer]], I believe I've done a good job getting necessary information. Great? No. More work to be done to drive that collaboration.

	- ### Influence
		- 游댮 Recognized by peers as the most, or one of the most influential technical leaders within an org or across a large number of teams
		- 游리 Defines and advocates for architectural best practices that impact a large part of the org
			- Through North Star, but more to be done and need to go deeper
		- 游리 Improves the productivity and career growth of an org or large number of teams, including senior engineers through significant mentoring efforts #dev-plan/focus-area
			- I've participated in a lot of mentoring/teaching. Mostly with SE1s and Co-ops. Some people do come to me when they have specific question about Rails of all levels. Would like to be more pro-active in this area.
		- 游댮 Builds software that has a major impact on large parts of the organization #dev-plan/focus-area
	- ### Ownership & Impact
		- 游리 Acts as a DRI and independently leads high risk, cross functional projects #dev-plan/focus-area
			- Still have work to do with growing into the DRI role in general. My focus has been on mainly backend projects for the two projects I DRI'd. I did participate in the first phase of the unification project which involved working between many teams.
		- 游릭 Acts as manager for a small number of direct reports if appropriate when appropriate
			- When we were in limbo at the start of the year, I did my best to step in and take point in meetings and projects
		- 游릭 Extremely effective communicator that can be relied on to explain strategy and technical decision to internal and external stakeholders
			- I believe I'm able to effectively communicate ideas with both technical and non-technical people. I haven't had a ton of opportunities to demonstrate this here.
		- 游리 Defines and improves engineering culture at Wealthsimple
			- Participated in North Star meetings, made a few documents and suggested various ideas. But there's a lot more I can be doing and need to do more to follow through on ideas brought forward.

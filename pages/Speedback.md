		- Focus too much on addressing an issue with a solution which leads to rambling, you don't need to have an answer right then and there
			- Often people simply want to be heard, not to have their problem solved
			- Example with the goal alignment around switch to backend, there was a focus on "clarifying" thing. But the thing that was clarified wasn't the issue they brought.
			- Same with the lead on Bill Pay
				- Vic: "I feel like I don't know who owns bill pay"
				  Arsalan: "Let me provide some context ..." *Doesn't actually address Vic's comment, mentions vaguely who is supposed to own it, but not who actually owns it*

alias:: 100-ideas

- The Rules
	- Until May 6th, I will come up with at least one idea per day, a total of 100 ideas
		- Doing just one idea per day will give me 56 ideas
	- None of the ideas need to be good, practical, novel or even feasible
	- The simply need to be an idea
	- Once I'm done with the list I can draw inspiration from the ideas and make something out of some of them

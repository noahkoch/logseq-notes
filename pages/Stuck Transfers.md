	- Stuck since March 13th, AMR was marked as failed but activities were not cancelled
	- Caused by bug solved in PR: [https://github.com/wealthsimple/asset-movement-service/pull/905](https://github.com/wealthsimple/asset-movement-service/pull/905)
- HQ20JBMK1CAD
	- Possibly a DIY bug?
	- https://wealthsimple.atlassian.net/browse/EOC-76480
	- Client was permitted multiple free trials (according to the client)
	- Timeline
		- They were given a free trial in Feb, AMR was created
		- Then they were downgraded, assets moved to CAD account
		- Then they received another free trial (re-upgraded Mar 22 10:31am ET), upgrade started, AMR never created
- HQ4SD3FK0CAD
	- AMR never created
	- Inkind Transfer State is N/A
	- https://wealthsimple.atlassian.net/browse/EOC-76634
	- Moved to upgrade_started after I created the AMR manually
- HQ43NPT04CAD
	- This appears to be similar to HQ20JBMK1CAD
	- Client re-upgraded
	- The original upgrade and downgrade both created AMRs
	- The re-upgrade did not have an AMR created

- HQ4HM7CK8USD
	- Cash was left in the account
	- Honestly, no idea why, that money should have been settled when they downgraded
	- Some cash was moved on downgrade, but just not all of it?

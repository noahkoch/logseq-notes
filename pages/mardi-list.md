  Be Famous 
  To be well known for her writing. 
  
  Rehearse phone call
  Basic “hey, what's up? Kind of phone call”, no. But she said there's a bit of anxiety where she does rehearse it for a lot of things but she is trying to do it less so she can get better at rolling with the punches. 
  
  What would constitute a perfect day
  Starts out raining so you could have a lazy day. Hot but not too hot, sunny. Walking around eating food and trying new things. Day ending with a concert. 
  
  But could also be a day at camp, depends on the context and who with. 
  
  Last time singing to someone else
  Seems to be on Wednesday when we were together after the grammar scavenger hunt
  
  Mind or body of a 30 year old
  Body. Since she is almost 30, she feels like she needs more wisdom and doesn't want to be stuck at 30.

  Possible: something sugar related. But no hunch.

  2017 Euro Trip

  If you knew that in one year you would die suddenly, would you change anything about the way you are now living? Why?
  Try to pull back at work but most likely switch to freelancing, travel more but not so much that it would take away from family. Be more honest with people who have had a significant impact on her life.
  
  What does friendship mean to you?
  We skipped this because it’s basically the same as “What do you value most in a friendship?”

- They were two. Sitting at a restaurant on the city’s west end slowly wrapping up their meal.
  
  The older one had wrinkles on their face that showed the stress of a previous marriage, failed relationships and arguments from when their children were teenagers. The most telling wrinkles were the smile lines that could have only come from decades of seeing the silver linings. 
  
  Younger had soft skin, but not too soft. They smoked a little bit in undergrad but not enough that you could tell without looking for signs of it. Their hair was tucked underneath a worn blue baseball cap — a gift from their last partner.
  
  Younger took the lead on the conversation for most of the night. Younger knew these things went one of two ways. Either the older one needed to feel like the most important person on the planet or they needed company which took them away from every day. Though this night, Younger had a much harder time pinning down where Older stood. 
  
  As time went by that night, Younger looked for ways to speed things along. Surely Older knew things ended at dinner. It was a school night after all and Younger had spent most of the night talking about how far behind they were on their thesis.
  
  Older had begun to talk about a coworker that was annoying them when a yawn snuck up on them. Younger took their phone off of the table and put it in their pocket.
  
  “I’m just going to run to the washroom and I’ll be ready to go.”
  
  “Ah, yes of course.” Older began reaching for their wallet. A little surprised by Younger taking the yawn as a sign of being ready to leave.

  “You can’t talk and walk that fast” Older said as they struggled to keep up.
  
  “Oh I sure can” Younger smiled over their shoulder.
  
  They quickly came to a red light where Older was able to finally catch up to Younger
  
  “Where abouts are you in the city again?” Younger asked.
  
  “Oh just off University.” Waiting for Younger’s reaction, Older was curious as to why they asked. Did Older impress Younger enough to want to continue the night?

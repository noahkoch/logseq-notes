	- Chat with Fuad
		- Purpose of Google Sheets
			- Daily operational tasks that we need to review and amend
		- Anything that's not going through CDS Service needs to manually flip to aton_sent state
		- 95% of transfers can be updated through Atlas
		- Four types for manual
			- Specific set of RESPs
				- We get the documents back, but we still need to make an ATON request to get the assets back
				- [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LpVxoLr7B1yPdPPcmkPZypJmFhXyKzRJUgfhxDwale4/edit#gid=1410047646](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LpVxoLr7B1yPdPPcmkPZypJmFhXyKzRJUgfhxDwale4/edit#gid=1410047646)
					- Orange, resp_form_c_received denotes we haven't yet received assets
					- Ideally, we automatically make the ATON request at this point
			- Spousal RIFs
				- RRSP when you age out
				- We need to generate a macro for all of these
				- Spouse information is not included on the form
					- Example: transfer-zrAnYLnSUiy3EV2KtbRm2pAWD3G
			- LIRA
				- Pensions when you leave account
				- Quebec either has province as QC or PQ
					- Rarely we get a rejection because we need to send with PQ instead, we need a way to retry using PQ instead of our default of QC once we receive a rejection
					- No way to know which code to use until we received the rejection, not institution specific
			- MD Management
				- 1 or 2 transfers a year
				- Some accounts have a dot in their account, e.g. `1234.78`
				- Atlas sanitizes account number so the transfer would fail in CDS because the dot gets removed
		- RESP transfers
			- ASM = ATON for cash
				- Basically an EFT
			- Assets back through Fundserv
			- Fax out transfer from, get form C back
			- 90% of the time we get the assets back at the same time
		- ## Work Required
			- resp_form_c_received state
				- Send ATON request to get assets

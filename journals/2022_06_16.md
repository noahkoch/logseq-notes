- Thoughts on presentation
	- Not in survival mode
		- Leadership didn't take cuts, no cuts to benefits
		- Why not do attrition and have leadership take temporary cuts until then?
	- People mentioning "killedbygoogle"/"killedbymicrosoft" as an example of why experimentation is important
		- This cannot be our attitude as a company
		- This is people's retirement, not an email client
		- Feels like this indecision is what got us into this mess

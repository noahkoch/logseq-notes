- [[Dev Plan]] #wealthsimple
	- Going to define what my proficiencies are today
	- Talk to Chris about [[Dev Plan]] during our 1:1 on [[Mar 8th, 2022]]
		- I picked three proficiencies I'd like to work towards
- #therapy-concerns I have a fear right now that I will be afraid of change or that anytime I do need to make a change/optimization that I won't do it. I fear that Mardi might judge me if I suggest we do something. Like right now I think it might be a good financial decision to sell my car when I get back to Toronto. But is that my over-optimizer talking? or is it actually something logical? If it's the latter how will Mardi know that it's the latter. #mardi-check-in
- Created a [[tags]] page
	- Need to figure out how this can be presented nicely, a bunch of random tags are being imported at the moment :/

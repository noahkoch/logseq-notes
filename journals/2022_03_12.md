- On the emotional side of this car. I’ve been thinking about why I actually bought the car. It was ultimately about filling a hole after the breakup — all of Quebec was really about that (thought I have really wanted to learn French). Travel in general for seems like I’ve been just flying through a checklist of places I want to go. I’m rarely thinking about what I want to actually experience there. I’m perfectly content with having a beer or cocktail at a local brewery. This extensive trip would have ultimately just been to see how many kilometres I could put up with, with a few nice things to look at along the way.
- Travel for me in the future will more be about getting to experience things with someone else who’s already important in my life. But for solo travel, I want it to be about taking a step back from my normal life, not just living in a different place.

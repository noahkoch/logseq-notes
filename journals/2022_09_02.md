- So full disclosure, I’ve been anxious (not the right word but let’s go with that) about today and turned into a complete yes man this past week which stupidly spilled into the weekend. That’s all to say 5 would be fine however I'm helping a friend move around 6 near Coxwell station. I think it'll take about an hour. I have a birthday party tonight as well that technically starts at 7, but I think they're going all night so I can be pretty late for that if you want to talk between the moving stuff and the birthday?

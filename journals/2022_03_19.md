	- Abstracts Review
	- Bug: Edit button disappearing on old journal page
	- 1.  Abstract Submissions
	  2. Reviewers (sprinkler, reviewers to abstracts)
	  3. Planner
	- Look into a better category selection interface
	- Only show categories on submission edit for the relevant conference
	- Little Fixes
		- Date not working properly on the submission page
		- Put spaces in smooshed names
	- Logout process after being an admin then trying to login as a personal user is not working properly unless refreshing the page
		- Probably caused by not clearing the admin token when hitting logout in Rails Admin
	- myAccount page, don't show empty sections
	- Back and cancel buttons not showing for submissions edit
